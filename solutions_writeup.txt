1. syntax/definition: 

error on line 57 because we were pasing two arguments into the function has_cache_expired, which was defined on line 32 as accepting only one argument

solution was to add expire_in_days argument to definition on line 32

2. caching:

program scraped NYTimes every time, never drawing from cache, because the has_cache_expired would always say that time had expired, which is the condition under which the program will scrape

solution was to change the > in line 46 to a <, so that the program would recognize when time hadn't expired

3. repeated content:

line 183 would pull everything from the targed <h6>, which includes more than just the title

solution was to get just the first child (an <a> that includes the actual title), by adding a .contents[0] after the <h6>

4. undesired content:
